# Thesis

This is the algorithm used to run the tests explained in my work of thesis.
The algorithm is developed on Python 3.7.10

In the file named How_to_use.py can be found a guided example on how to use the functions provided in the file named working_with_the_data.py. 
The remaining files are needed for working_with_the_data.py (and consequently also How_to_use.py) to work. 
They are organized in utils.py and corrected_ttest.py
